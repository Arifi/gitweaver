h1. DOWNLOAD from the repo. For CC/CS6 you will need to use the ZXP, all other versions will be able to use MXI

h2. Introduction

GITWeaver is a Dreamweaver Extension that hooks DreamWeaver into TortoiseGIT. 
 
h2. Installation

Download and install TortoiseGIT from "http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/":http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/
Download the extension from the Download page
.mxp/.zxp extension package file that you downloaded. The Adobe extension manager will handle the installation.
When you run Dreamweaver now, you will see a new menu in the menu bar, called GIT (this is the PAGE menu) and under right click in the site explorer on any site that is a working path :o)

If you right click in Dreamweavers file explorer and the menu is greyed out its probably because the root of the site doesnt contain a .git/_git/.GIT/_GIT folder.
